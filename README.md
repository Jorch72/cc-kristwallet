# kristwallet
A reference wallet for Krist, a ComputerCraft currency.

Currently this is the only functional standalone wallet. I'm hoping this changes in the future, but not until this is "finished."

This repository is polled by the program to download updates. It also lists a reliable syncNode for miners.
